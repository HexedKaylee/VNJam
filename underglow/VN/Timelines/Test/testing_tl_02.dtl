narrator: The shade manifests an arm, a glazed teapot in its newly-formed hand.[n+] They lift it, and with a practiced lilt of the wrist, level its spout over the matching teacup sitting in front of you.[n]Out of the teapot trickles a thin liquid, light blue and mildly luminous.[n+]\
Crystals, so small and translucent that you can only register them by the way they bend and break the light shimmering through the stream, riding the way down.[n+]\
You watch the little shards spill into the cup. You couldn't count them if you tried.[n]\
For a fleeting moment, you try anyways ——[n+]\
And that's when you see your face\: a mask reflected in the rippling blue.[n+] Three dark circles constrained by plaster white.[n+]\
Is this why they called you "a Mask?"[n]...[n] The only thing you can see is the mask. Your eyes, your mouth, your shoulders——all just match the murky blackness of the sky. But that pristine mask is...[n+]\
No.[n] That's wrong.[n+]\
It's the opposite, in fact.[n+]\
There is no mask.[n+]\
Where there should be a mask, there is simply nothing.[n] The luminous blue of the tea and three black dots floating.[n+]\
...[n+]\
You roll your head to the side, but you can't see the mask at the edge of your vision, either.[n] The curvature of your head appears in the teacup, past where the edge of the mask should be;[n] your neck and shoulders descend from the nothingness, as if they have no relation with the eyes that see them.[n+]\
But there's no mask.[n+]\
A nonexistent surface that seems to hide anything behind it, but does not itself show.[n]\
...[n]\
You can touch it.[n] You can feel it.[n] Your fingers press against the formless barrier, feel for its rounded edges and gentle curvature, but you still can't see it.[n] You concentrate on it, will your foolish eyes to observe it, stare at it...[n+]\
But there is simply nothing to see.[n+]\
All the effort does is reward you with another fact\: You can't see your hands, either.[n] Pulling the... hand? ...grabbing at your face away, you can trace the slope of your watery arm as it fades out into nothingness before reaching the wrist.[n] You can stretch it, flex the fingers, pull at your non-mask Mask's mask with it (it doesn't move)...[n+]\
but you can't see it.[n+]\
—— You're interrupted before you can further contemplate the state of your being.
